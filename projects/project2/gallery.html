                        <figcaption>The Big Bend National Park logo was developed, as part of a logo project for the New Media Design Digital Survey class at the Rochester Institute for Technology. The mountain cats are very common at the national park, thus the reason why a mountain cat was used as a main theme for the logo design. However, the three major mountains (Mt. Emory and the Mule Ears) outline was incorporated into the mountain cat's legs.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Animal Farm, written by George Orwell, is a satire of the Soviet Communism. When given the challenge of designing a book cover for the New Media Design Digital Survey class, it was natural to create a book cover that parallels the anti-communist propaganda that was frequently used throughout the history. Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop were used for this design.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Twilight Peaks was created while taking a dual credit class at Austin Community College as a part-time student. Like "The Wind", a similar approach was used to create this digital art by using Illustrator and Geometric to create an image of mountains. Twilight Peaks was selected by the faculty to be shown at the Dougherty Arts Center as part of Austin Community College's annual arts show.

                        <figcaption>Texas School for the Deaf's High School logo was designed with the intention of being used for their polo shirts (for teachers and administrators).  Negative space approach was used, with only one color to keep the embroidery and printing costs low. A hidden message was also incorporated with the design, as the clock hands state 18:56 in the military time, which reflects Texas School for the Deaf's founding year, 1856. </figcaption>
